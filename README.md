This repository contains a simple Perl program demonstrating a common off-by-one error. The program iterates through an array, but the indexing logic is flawed and may cause an error or unexpected behavior.

The `bug.pl` file showcases the error. The `bugSolution.pl` file shows how to fix the error. Feel free to experiment and modify the code. Please open issues for any questions or suggestions.
